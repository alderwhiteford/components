### Welcome to Alder's Component Library!

This is my sandbox for messing around with all things related to CSS / HTML / Frontend. Things to note: 
* There is no design system (as of now)
* I am dedicated to keeping the only dependencies of the application be react and react-dom
* Feel free to use any of the components in this library (add to project using **npm install @alderwhiteford/components**)

The library is fully tested and will have new releases whenever a new component is finished.
